Eric,

here you go:
a) select the NeXTUSA keyboard (I use the German one, that's why it did not
work)
b) start Configure.app
c) get the InfoPanel
d) hold down Ctrl+Alt (left side)
e) click on the icon.......... Sproing!


Inside the appwrapper you find a tiff called Information.tiff - look into it
(after you sawthe anim). You can try to change the Information.sxxxx file to get a nicer anim...
:-) (Ha ha ha!!!) I hadn't the time yet. But if you do it, please send me a
copy!

Have fun now!

Atze
