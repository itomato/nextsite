Here it is:

If you have NEXTSTEP 3.1 on Black hardware and your having problems
copying files from the cdrom. Swap the CDROM filesystem with the one
found on NeXTSTEP 3.0 and you will be a happy camper once again.
This "bug fix" only works on Black hardware, and the White hardware
has the same bug but it does not have the 3.0 filesystem which we
can swap.

Here's what your directory should look like once the swap has
been done:

/usr/filesystems/CDROM.fs

-r--r--r--  1 root        3546 Mar 25  1992 CDROM.fs.tiff
-rw-r--r--  1 root          10 Oct 30 16:06 CDROM.label
-rw-r--r--  1 root          16 Oct 30 16:06 CDROM.name
-r--r--r--  1 root        3546 Mar 25  1992 CDROM.openfs.tiff
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root       24576 Jul 22  1992 CDROM.util*
-rw-r--r--  1 root       46224 Jul 22  1992 CDROM_reloc

Please make sure the the CDROM.util* file has the -rwsr-xr-x
permissions. The "s" is easy to miss (I know, I missed it...)
(chmod u+s CDROM.util*, to set the s permission)

Thanks again to all the great people on the net for the advice
and help!
